# NYC-Educational-Data-Analysis
 
One of the most controversial issues in the U.S. public educational system is the efficacy of standardized tests, and whether they're unfair to certain groups. Investigating the correlations between SAT scores and demographics might be an interesting angle to approach analysis of this issue. New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income, and gender with SAT scores is a good way to determine whether the SAT is a fair test.  We'll find out in this project.

About the SATs: The SAT, or Scholastic Aptitude Test, is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when deciding who to admit, so it's fairly important to perform well on it.

The test consists of three sections, each of which has 800 possible points. The combined score is out of 2,400 possible points (while this number has changed a few times, the data set for our project is based on 2,400 total points). Organizations often rank high schools by their average SAT scores. The scores are also considered a measure of overall school district quality.
